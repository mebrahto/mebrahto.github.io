    <h2 style="color:Red">I am from a small country in East Africa called Eritrea. Eritrea is on the coastline of the Red Sea and borders Sudan, Ethiopia and Djibouti. Even though Eritrea is a very young and small country, there is
      a lot of ancient history.

      I was born in a city in the northern part of Eritrea called Adikehe. Most people in Adikehe have to make a living doing agricultural, farming or by being a shepherd. My family is one of those people who live and work by farming and
      agricultural.
      I am the last of eight kids from the Tesfay family.

      After I finished high school in Adikehe, I went straight to do my national service. Each person is required to do this in a military training camp in Sawa. This is where I stayed for one year before I continued my education at a technical
      school.

      When I was in Sawa, I had a lot of suffering and hard times to survive. This is one of the many reasons why I escaped my country to come to America. I came to America in 2017 and made goals for myself to go to school and work so that I can also
      help my family, since I am the first to come to this country safely. I am now looking to continue my education at the Refugee Hope Care.<h2>
