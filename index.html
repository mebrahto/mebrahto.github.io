          <h2 style="color:green">I am from a small country in East Africa called Eritrea. Eritrea is on the coastline of the Red Sea and borders Sudan, Ethiopia and Djibouti. Even though Eritrea is a very young and small country, there is
            a lot of ancient history.
            I was born in a city in the northern part of Eritrea called Adikehe. Most people in Adikehe have to make a living doing agricultural, farming or by being a shepherd. My family is one of those people who live and work by farming and
            agricultural.
            I am the last of eight kids from the Tesfay family.

            After I finished high school in Adikehe, I went straight to do my national service. Each person is required to do this in a military training camp in Sawa. This is where I stayed for one year before I continued my education at a technical
            school.

            When I was in Sawa, I had a lot of suffering and hard times to survive. This is one of the many reasons why I escaped my country to come to America. I came to America in 2017 and made goals for myself to go to school and work so that I
            can also
            help my family, since I am the first to come to this country safely. I am now looking to continue my education at the Refugee Hope Care.<h2>
